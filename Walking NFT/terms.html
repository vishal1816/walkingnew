                    <h2>9. Assumption of Risk</h2>
                    <p>You understand and agree that the Licensed NFTs are made solely for entertainment purposes only.
                        You agree and understand that that: (1) the market and prices for a blockchain asset are
                        extremely volatile and subjective and collectible blockchain assets, such as the Licensed NFTs,
                        have no inherent or intrinsic value, and fluctuations in the price of such blockchain assets
                        could materially and adversely affect the price and value of your Licensed NFTs; (2) there are
                        risks involved with using internet-based currency and asset, including, but not limited to, risk
                        of hardware, software, internet connection failure, risk of malicious software, and risk that
                        unauthorized parties may gain access to your personal information including such information and
                        assets contained in your digital wallet or elsewhere; (3) internet-based currency and assets are
                        not currently regulated by any regulatory regimes, and new regulations or policies that may
                        materially affect the value of any Licensed NFTs; (4) there is an inherent risk that you may
                        lose access due to loss of private keys, custodial error, or even purchaser error; (5) there are
                        risks related to taxation; and (6) RCC does not make any guarantees or representations about the
                        availability of the Licensed NFTs or the art or that they will host the Licensed NFTs or the Art
                        in any specific location for any specific period of time.</p>
                    <p>You agree that you have received sufficient information to make an informed decision regarding
                        the decision to purchase or otherwise obtain the Licensed NFTs and that you understand and agree
                        that you are solely responsible for determining the value, nature, and appropriateness of the
                        above risks for yourself.</p>
                    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>

                        INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL RCC BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY
                        INDIRECT, EXTRAORDINARY, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
                        (INCLUDING LOSS OF DATA, GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, DIMINUTION OF VALUE OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE
                        LOSS, TECHNOLOGY FAILURE, OR MALFUNCTION, REVENUE, PROFITS, USE OR OTHER ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE
                        RELATED TO ANY LICENSED NFT OR OTHERWISE) HOWEVER ARISING, EVEN IF RCC KNOWS THERE IS A
                        POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>
                    <h2>11. Release</h2>
                    <p>IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION THAT REQUIRES A SPECIFIC STATEMENT REGARDING RELEASE THEN
                        THE FOLLOWING APPLIES.  FOR EXAMPLE, CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS MUST, AS A CONDITION OF THIS
                        AGREEMENT, WAIVE THE APPLICABILITY OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH STATES, “A
                        GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST
                        IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE
                        MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.&quot;  YOU HEREBY WAIVE THIS SECTION
                        OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE.  YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY SIMILAR PROVISION IN LAW, REGULATION, OR
                        CODE THAT HAS THE SAME INTENT OR EFFECT AS THE AFOREMENTIONED RELEASE.  YOU RELEASE US FROM ANY
                        LIABILITY RELATING TO OUR SITE OR RCC CONTENT, AND YOU RELEASE US, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,
                        EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AND AGENTS FROM ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF
                        OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST US. THIS RELEASE DOES NOT APPLY TO NEW
                        JERSEY USERS.</p>
                    <p>If you are a resident of a jurisdiction that requires a specific statement regarding release,
                        then the following applies. For example, California residents must, as a condition of this
                        Agreement, waive the applicability of California Civil Code Section 1542 which states, “a
                        general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist
                        in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have
                        materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.” You hereby waive this section of the
                        California Civil Code. You hereby waive any similar provision in law, regulation, or code that
                        has the same intent or effect as the aforementioned release. You release us from any liability

                        affiliates, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any
                        way connected with any claim you have against us. This release does not apply to New Jersey

                    <h2>12. Digital Millenium Copyright Act of 1988</h2>
                    <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners
                        who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under the U.S.
                        copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by RCC infringe your
                        copyright, you, or your agent may send to RCC a notice requesting that the material be removed
                        or access to it be blocked. Any notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act
                        on its behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered
                        sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon RCC actual knowledge of facts or
                        circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident. If you believe in good faith
                        that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you
                        to send to RCC a counter-notice. All notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current
                        statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details. RCC’s
                        Copyright Agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement or counter notices can be reached
                        as follows: through a direct message to RCC’s Twitter at @RNDMCHARACTERS.</p>

                        <li>your use of any RCC Site; </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>This defense and indemnification obligation will survive this Agreement. You also agree that you
                        have a duty to defend us against such claims and we may require you to pay for an attorney(s) of
                        our choice in such cases.  You agree that this indemnity extends to requiring you to pay for our

                        described in this paragraph, we may elect to settle with the party/parties making the claim and

                    <h2>16. Choice of Law &amp; Venue</h2>

                        the State of California and US Federal law. Foreign laws do not apply. The offer and acceptance
                        of this contract are deemed to have occurred in the State of California.</p>
                    <h2>17. Forum</h2>
                    <p>By using this Site, you agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy you may have against
                        us, RCC, or the Site arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with this Agreement or
                        any Licensed NFTs purchased shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration
                        administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and conducted before a single
                        arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Consumer Rules and Procedures established by AAA (“Rules
                        and Procedures”); (2) the claim or dispute must be brought within one (1) year of the first date
                        of the event giving rise to such action (does not apply to New Jersey users) and the arbitration
                        shall be held in Los Angeles, California or at such other location as may be mutually agreed
                        upon by you and RCC; (3) the arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the Federal
                        Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege
                        recognized at law; (4) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or
                        representative basis; arbitration can decide only your and/or RCC’ individual claims; and the
                        arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be
                        similarly situated (this does not apply to New Jersey users); (5) both parties will bear their
                        own costs of representation and filing for the dispute; (6) where possible and allowed for under
                        the AAA Rules and Procedures both parties shall be entitled to appear electronically or
                        telephonically for all proceedings;  and (7) with the exception of subpart (4) above, if any
                        part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or
                        otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by AAA, then the balance of this
                        arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms
                        as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.
                        If, however, subpart (4) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of
                        this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor RCC shall be entitled to
                        arbitrate their dispute. For more information on AAA and its Rules and Procedures, users may
                        visit the AAA website at<a href="http://www.adr.org/"> http://www.adr.org</a>.  In the event
                        that any portion of this arbitration provision is found to be unenforceable or void, both
                        parties agree to settle any disputes arising out of this Agreement in a court of competent
                        jurisdiction located in or near Los Angeles, California.</p>
                    <h2>18. Class Action Waiver</h2>
                    <p>You and RCC agree that any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute whether through a court
                        of law or arbitration shall be solely conducted on an individual basis.  You agree that you will
                        not seek to have any dispute heard as a class action, representative action, collective action,
                        or private attorney general action.</p>
                    <h2>19. Severability</h2>
                    <p>In the event that a provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, conflicting with another
                        provision of the Agreement, or otherwise unenforceable, the Agreement will remain in force as
                        though it had been entered into without that unenforceable provision being included in it.</p>
                    <p>If two or more provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement you may have with RCC are
                        deemed to conflict with each other’s operation, you agree that RCC shall have the sole right to
                        elect which provision remains in force.  </p>
                    <h2>20. Waiver</h2>
                    <p>We reserve all rights permitted to us under this Agreement as well as under the provisions of any
                        applicable law.  Our non-enforcement of any particular provision or provisions of this Agreement
                        or any applicable law should not be construed as our waiver of the right to enforce that same
                        provision under the same or different circumstances at any time in the future.</p>
                    <h2>21. No Joint Venture</h2>
                    <p>This Agreement shall not constitute a joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency
                        relationship between the parties.</p>
                    <h2>22. Survival</h2>
                    <p>All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive
                        termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers,
                        indemnity, and limitations of liability.  You agree that we are not required to provide you with
